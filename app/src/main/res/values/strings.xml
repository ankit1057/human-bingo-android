        Find a public place with plenty of foot traffic, like an airport, mall, or parking lot.
        Your bingo card is randomly generated each time you play. Tap each type of person as you see them.
        Win by crossing off a complete row from side to side, from top to bottom or from corner to corner. That\'s bingo.
